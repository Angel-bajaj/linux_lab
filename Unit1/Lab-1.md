 # ✅File Permissions with `chmod` and `chown`

---

##  🚀1. Understanding File Permissions in Linux

Each file/directory in Linux has:

* **Owner** → The user who created the file.
* **Group** → A group of users who may share access.
* **Others** → Everyone else.

### 📍Permission Types

* **r** → Read (4 in numeric)
* **w** → Write (2 in numeric)
* **x** → Execute (1 in numeric)

### 📍Permission Layout

Example from `ls -l`:

```
-rwxr-xr--
```

Breakdown:

* `-` → Regular file (`d` = directory, `l` = symlink, etc.)
* `rwx` → Owner has read, write, execute
* `r-x` → Group has read, execute
* `r--` → Others have read only

---

##  🚀2. `chmod` – Change File Permissions

### Syntax

```bash
chmod [options] mode filename
```

Modes can be set in **numeric (octal)** or **symbolic** form.

---

### 📍(A) Numeric (Octal) Method

Each permission is represented as a number:

* Read = 4
* Write = 2
* Execute = 1

Add them up:

* `7 = rwx`
* `6 = rw-`
* `5 = r-x`
* `4 = r--`
* `0 = ---`

#### Example:

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```

Meaning:

* Owner: 7 → `rwx`
* Group: 5 → `r-x`
* Others: 5 → `r-x`

---

### 📍(B) Symbolic Method

Use `u` (user/owner), `g` (group), `o` (others), `a` (all).
Operators:

* `+` → Add permission
* `-` → Remove permission
* `=` → Assign exact permission

#### Examples:

```bash
chmod u+x script.sh     # Add execute for owner
chmod g-w notes.txt     # Remove write from group
chmod o=r file.txt      # Set others to read only
chmod a+r report.txt    # Everyone gets read access
```

---

### 📍(C) Recursive Changes

```bash
chmod -R 755 /mydir
```

* `-R` → applies changes recursively to all files/subdirectories.

##  🚀3. `chown` – Change File Ownership

### Syntax

```bash
chown [options] new_owner:new_group filename
```

### Examples:

```bash
chown angel file.txt           # Change owner to user 'angel'
chown angel:dev file.txt       # Change owner to 'angel' and group to 'dev'
chown :dev file.txt            # Change only group to 'dev'
chown -R angel:dev /project    # Recursive ownership change
```

---

##  🚀4. Putting It All Together

### Example Scenario

```bash
touch project.sh
ls -l project.sh
```

Output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 angel dev 0 Aug 19 12:00 project.sh
```

Now:

```bash
chmod 700 project.sh       # Only owner has rwx
chmod u+x,g-w project.sh   # Add execute for user, remove write for group
chown root:admin project.sh # Change owner to root and group to admin
```


---

##  🚀5. Quick Reference Table

| Numeric | Permission | Meaning      |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 0       | ---        | No access    |
| 1       | --x        | Execute only |
| 2       | -w-        | Write only   |
| 3       | -wx        | Write + Exec |
| 4       | r--        | Read only    |
| 5       | r-x        | Read + Exec  |
| 6       | rw-        | Read + Write |
| 7       | rwx        | Full access  |

---

✅ **Key Tip**: Use **numeric for quick settings** (e.g., 755, 644) and **symbolic for fine adjustments** (`u+x`, `g-w`).

## 📌Extra questions -
**Q1** Difference Between `chmod` and `chown` ?

In Unix-based operating systems (Linux, macOS), `chmod` and `chown` are two important commands used to manage files and directories. While both are related to permissions and ownership, they serve different purposes.

### `chmod` - Change Mode

The `chmod` command is used to change the **permissions** of a file or directory. Permissions define who can read, write, or execute a file.


### Permissions:
- **Read (r)**: Permission to view the contents of a file.
- **Write (w)**: Permission to modify or delete the file.
- **Execute (x)**: Permission to run the file as a program (for executable files or scripts).

### Example Usage:
1. `chmod 755 myfile`  
   Grants:
   - Read, write, and execute permissions to the **owner**.
   - Read and execute permissions to the **group** and **others**.

2. `chmod u+x script.sh`  
   Adds execute permission to the **owner** of `script.sh`.

3. `chmod 644 myfile.txt`  
   Grants:
   - Read and write permissions to the **owner**.
   - Read permission to the **group** and **others**.

### `chown` - Change Owner

The `chown` command is used to change the **ownership** of a file or directory. This includes both the **user owner** and the **group owner**.


- `[user]` specifies the new owner of the file.
- `[group]` specifies the new group of the file (optional).

### Example Usage:
1. `chown alice:admins file.txt`  
   Changes the **owner** of `file.txt` to `alice` and the **group** to `admins`.

2. `chown bob file.txt`  
   Changes the **owner** of `file.txt` to `bob`, while keeping the existing group unchanged.

3. `chown :staff file.txt`  
   Changes the **group** of `file.txt` to `staff` (no change to the owner).

## Summary of Differences:

| Command  | Purpose                             | Example Usage                                      |
|----------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `chmod`  | Changes **permissions** of files    | `chmod 755 myfile` (Set read, write, execute)      |
| `chown`  | Changes **ownership** of files      | `chown alice:admins file.txt` (Change owner and group) |

---

Understanding the difference between `chmod` and `chown` is crucial for managing file access and ownership in a secure environment. Use `chmod` to modify what users can do with a file, and `chown` to modify who owns the file and its associated group.



**Q2** How do you check current directory and user ?

### Checking the Current Directory and Current User

In Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS), you can easily check your **current directory** and **current user** using simple terminal commands.


###  Check the Current Directory

To check your **current directory**, use the `pwd` command:

```bash
pwd
```

### Checking the Current Directory and Current User

In Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS), you can easily check your **current directory** and **current user** using simple terminal commands.


#### 1. Check the Current Directory

To check your **current directory**, use the `pwd` command:

```bash
pwd

$ pwd
/home/alice/projects
```

**Checking the Current User** 

In Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS), you can check the **current user** using the `whoami` command.


### Command

To find out the current user, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
whoami
