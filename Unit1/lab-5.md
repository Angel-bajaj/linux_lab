# ‚úÖLAB 5 - Starter Kit and Automation

## üéØ Purpose

The `starter_kit.sh` script is a shell automation tool that helps set up a basic project structure quickly and consistently. It is especially useful for data science or software projects that require organized folders from the beginning.

This script creates a folder named `project/` with three subdirectories: `scripts/`, `docs/`, and `data/`. Each subdirectory also contains a placeholder `README.md` file to describe its purpose.

By automating this repetitive task, the script saves time and reduces setup errors.

---

## üìÅ What It Creates

After running the script, this folder structure is created:
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```


Each `README.md` file contains a simple title indicating the folder's purpose.

## üß™ Example Run
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ==========================================================
# Data Science Starter Pack - Full Setup Script
# Run as: bash starter_pack.sh
# ==========================================================

set -e

# === Base directory ===
BASE_DIR="/home/vibhu0077/ds_starter"
APP_DIR="$BASE_DIR/app"
VENV_DIR="$BASE_DIR/.venv"

echo "üìÇ Base Directory: $BASE_DIR"
echo "üìÇ App Directory: $APP_DIR"
echo "üõ†Ô∏è Virtual Environment: $VENV_DIR"

# === Step 1: Create base and app directories ===
if [ ! -d "$BASE_DIR" ]; then
  echo "‚û°Ô∏è Creating base directory..."
  mkdir -p "$BASE_DIR"
else
  echo "‚úÖ Base directory already exists."
fi

  echo "‚û°Ô∏è Creating app directory..."
  mkdir -p "$APP_DIR"
else
  echo "‚úÖ App directory already exists."
fi

cd "$BASE_DIR"


# Step 1: Install required packages
sudo apt-get update
#sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip


# === Step 2: Create virtual environment ===
if [ ! -d "$VENV_DIR" ]; then
  echo "‚û°Ô∏è Creating hidden virtual environment..."
  python3 -m venv "$VENV_DIR"
else
  echo "‚úÖ Virtual environment already exists."
fi

# === Step 3: Activate environment ===
echo "‚û°Ô∏è Activating virtual environment..."
source "$VENV_DIR/bin/activate"

# === Step 4: Upgrade pip ===
echo "‚û°Ô∏è Upgrading pip..."
pip install --upgrade pip

# === Step 5: Install packages ===
echo "‚û°Ô∏è Installing Streamlit and libraries..."
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

# === Step 6: Create sample Streamlit app ===
APP_FILE="$APP_DIR/app.py"
echo "‚û°Ô∏è Creating Streamlit app at $APP_FILE..."

cat > "$APP_FILE" << 'EOF'

# Tab 1: Show random dataset
with tab1:
    st.header("Random Data Preview")

# Tab 4: Heatmap
with tab4:

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()

    st.pyplot(fig)

# === Step 7: Success message ===
echo "‚úÖ Setup complete!"
echo "To activate environment later, run:"
echo "source $VENV_DIR/bin/activate"

## ‚úÖ Summary

This lab demonstrates how automation with shell scripts can improve efficiency during project setup. The starter_kit.sh script ensures a consistent starting structure for any new project with minimal manual effort.


# ‚ùìExtra Questions 

**Q1.**What does `mkdir -p` do?

The `mkdir` command is used to create directories in Unix/Linux systems.

The `-p` flag stands for **"parents"**, and it has two key benefits:

1. **Creates parent directories as needed**:  

   If the parent directories do not exist, `mkdir -p` will create them automatically.

   Example:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p project/scripts

This command will:
 - `Create the project/ directory if it doesn't exist.`

- `Then create the scripts/ subdirectory inside it.`
- `No error if directory exists:`
- `If the directory already exists, mkdir -p will not throw an error. It just moves on silently.`


**Q2.**Why is Automation Useful in DevOps?

## ‚öôÔ∏è What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a set of practices that combines software development (**Dev**) and IT operations (**Ops**). Its goal is to shorten the software development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

---

## üöÄ Why Automation Matters

Automation is one of the **core pillars** of DevOps. It enables faster, more consistent, and more reliable workflows by reducing manual effort.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Automation in DevOps

### 1. **Speed and Efficiency**
- Repetitive tasks like testing, building, and deploying are done automatically.
- Saves time and reduces manual workload.

### 2. **Consistency and Reliability**
- Automation ensures the same process runs every time, reducing human errors.
- Configuration and deployment steps are repeatable and version-controlled.

### 3. **Scalability**
- Automation can handle large-scale environments effortlessly.
- Infrastructure can be replicated across multiple environments with tools like Terraform or Ansible.

### 4. **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
- Automation is critical for CI/CD pipelines.
- Code changes are tested and deployed automatically, allowing for rapid and safe releases.

### 5. **Improved Collaboration**
- Dev and Ops teams share the same tools and workflows.
- Automated pipelines reduce friction and encourage better communication.
